# Interviewing Tips

## Behavioural Questions

Most (tech) interviews are conducted using _Behavioural Questions_. These questions are used to explore your work experience and determine your ability to be successful at the role you're interviewing for. While they can be used to filter out exaggerated claims and other red flags, they are also useful to highlight potential areas for growth if you were to join the company. This clarifies to the hiring manager what potential a candidate has a long term hire, which can feed data into the compensation decision as well.

It's easy to bomb these questions if you haven't thought of their _purpose_ before. The best indicator for future performance is past performance (note: not a _guarantee_, but an _indicator_). Interviewers need _data_ to make those determinations, and this technique is a reliable mechanism to collect it. At most companies, the results of the behavioural interview are added to technical screening data in a "de-briefing" session, in which stakeholders make the hiring decision.

### Examples

* Tell me about a time when... (area of interest to the interviewer)
* ...Followed by questions to probe on the candidate's experience.

**_Can you tell me about a time you were facing a difficult deadline in a project?_**
- When did you first talk to your leadership about the problems?
- What actions did you take?
- Were you able to finish on time?
- Was the launch successful (irrespective of meeting the date)?

**_Can you describe an example of you disagreeing with your manager, or a co-worker? What was it about? What happened after that?_**
- How did you solve the disagreement?
- Did you agree with the end result? Why, or why not?

**_Can you tell me about a time you delivered a project against all odds?_**
- Why was the project at risk? 
- What was the outcome, from a customer perspective?
- Did you have any help from colleagues?

And so on. You get the idea.

## How do I answer these questions?

With honesty. That's the key part - draw examples from past experience. Often, people improvise (when not straight lying) to deliver an answer they believe makes them look good. Do not do this. Experienced interviewers are skilled in picking up your exaggerations; They are themselves experienced professionals, having delivered multiple real-world problems. They can tell when you're polishing your story.

Instead, understand that companies are not looking for "perfect examples" but realistic ones. Be honest about your own shortcomings, focusing on what you learned and what you'd do differently with your newly-gained knowledge. Absolutely highlight your accomplishments and talk about how you are raising the bar in different aspects of your work, but do so by making claims accompanied with data. Companies want to see that you have _consistent positive behaviour_ at work, and an ability to _learn and develop_ new skills as you progress in your career.

Let's look at an example:

_At Amazon on 2020, my team was tasked with delivering a new feature on the payment service; By Q4, we should accept a new payment method, with complete integration with reconciliation and fraud services. I was tasked with integration to the fraud services. My first challenge was in consuming their APIs without incurring into throttling limits and other non-functional concerns; We expected a high throughput due to ramped up adoption of the new payment method, and had to provision capacity to adequately handle customer traffic. I conducted weekly sync ups with Frauds team to, at first, clarify our requirements, and then track deliverables on their end to ensure our launch could happen on time and without issues. I had to escalate two issues to principal engineers in order to resolve minor technical conflicts, but otherwise the reviews happened on time and on schedule. The project was launched in October 2020, on time, and adoption of the new payment method was 7% above expectations. Despite this, our capacity planning ensured that we did not incur into throttling issues, leading to a 5% below average number of incidents, compared to other popular payment methods._ 

Why is this an acceptable answer?

## The SBI method

I strongly favour the `SBI` method: **S**ituation, **B**ehaviour, **I**mpact. It is also commonly known as `STAR` (Situation, Task, Action, Results). It's a technique to answer behavioural questions. It offers a simple structure that is easy to remember and works for the majority of questions you may be asked. It consists of the following:

* A "situation" block, which describes the context necessary to understand your actions;
* A description of the actions you've taken, or your "behaviour", within that context, enabling the results of the project;
* The "impact" of your actions to the project, and its end results.

With that in mind, let's review that answer:

> At Amazon on 2020, my team was tasked with delivering a new feature on the payment service; By Q4, we should accept a new payment method, with complete integration with reconciliation and fraud services.

This is our situation. The reader understands the importance and scale of the project we were assigned to.

> I was tasked with integration to the fraud services. My first challenge was in consuming their APIs without incurring into throttling limits and other non-functional concerns; We expected a high throughput due to ramped up adoption of the new payment method, and had to provision capacity to adequately handle customer traffic.

This is also part of the setup. Here, we are outlining our _own_ responsibilities in the project. Everyone wants to be a team player, and that's a great thing. In an interview, however, we're interested about _you_. What was _your_ role at this project?

> I conducted weekly sync ups with Frauds team to, at first, clarify our requirements, and then track deliverables on their end to ensure our launch could happen on time and without issues. I had to escalate two issues to principal engineers in order to resolve minor technical conflicts, but otherwise the reviews happened on time and on schedule.

And here we have our actions, demonstrating our behaviour. The decisions you have made, the difference you have made in the project. You can outline what is considered "common sense", but you also want to make sure they hear about what you did that is "above and beyond" what you'd fairly expect for your role. Remember, you're selling your skills here, so be a good salesperson!

> The project was launched in October 2020, on time, and adoption of the new payment method was 7% above expectations. Despite this, our capacity planning ensured that we did not incur into throttling issues, leading to a 5% below average number of incidents, compared to other popular payment methods.

And here we talk about results, showing data. It's not enough to say "and we were happily ever after", you need to demonstrate how success was measured and why and how you've reached this conclusion.

### Tips

* Study your resumé, reviewing your work experience for examples
* Consider other sources as well: community work, other things you do outside of 9-5 work
* Practice behavioural interviewing on _both sides_ if you can
* Learn about metrics and how to outline data in a narrative
* Avoid unnecessary words that don't add quality to your narrative: E.g "The project was delivered _quickly_" instead of "The project was delivered on time".

### Common Mistakes

**Inconsistent narrative**

Your answer should read like someone "describing the room" if you couldn't see it. You shouldn't jump between first and third person, and your tone should be neutral. Pretend you're interviewing for a TV show, or telling a story to a friend. If you were to write your answer down, it would read like a newspaper article.

**Be concise**

Do more with less. For example: 

> "We have achieved outstanding results with this motivated team, leading to a successful launch"

This is a drag to say and even worse to hear. Instead, prefer:

> "The project was launched by X with Y impact"

Save the poetry. I also love this Mark Twain's quote:

> "I didn't have time to write a short letter, so I wrote a long one instead."

**Vocabulary**

Avoid repetition, buzz words, stuttering ("like... uh... like... for example..."). Avoid complicated technical statements and jargon, unless strictly necessary. Your answer should be readable by anyone with basic background in your domain. You can introduce some explanation to your answer, when you can safely assume the reader is unfamiliar with the technical domain; But even then, remember the rule about being concise.

**Categorize your examples**

You are going to be asked questions on multiple topics: your (technical) competencies, your ability to work "under pression", to handle conflicts, to advise managers and upper leadership, to mentor younger peers, and so on. Have examples ready for different "categories" like this. One useful hint: certain companies (like Amazon) have guiding principles (Amazon has Leadership Principles) that outline the culture they hope to foster. These are usually available online for further reference, and are a great way to categorize your examples.
