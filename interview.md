# Interviewing Tips

## Behavioural Questions

Most (tech) interviews in NORAM are conducted using _Behavioural Questions_. These questions are very useful to understand how you perform work and deliver results. They are used to probe for details in a candidate's work history, clarifying what experience they actually have as professional software developers. They can filter out candidates making exaggerated claims about their performance, but they are also used to understand how you approach challenges and which areas you require mentoring to grow.

It's easy to bomb these questions if you haven't thought of their _purpose_ before. What the interviewer wants to do is assess your abilities beyond what you're claiming you're capable of. They also want to know if you'd be a good addition to their team. The best indicator for future performance is past performance (note: not a _guarantee_, but an _indicator_). As an interviewer, we need _data_ to make those decisions, and _peeling the onion_ using behavioural questions is a great tool to collect it.

### Examples

* Tell me about a time when... (area of interest)
** Followed by questions to probe on the candidate's experience.

**_Can you tell me about a time you were facing a difficult deadline in a project?_**
- When did you first talk to your leadership about the problems?
- What actions did you take?
- Were you able to finish on time?
- Was the launch successful (irrespective of meeting the date)?

**_Can you describe an example of you disagreeing with your manager, or a co-worker? What was it about? What happened after that?_**
- How did you solve the disagreement?
- Did you agree with the end result? Why, or why not?

**_Can you tell me about a time you delivered a project against all odds?_**
- Why was the project at risk? 
- What was the outcome, from a customer perspective?
- Did you have any help from colleagues?

And so on. You get the idea.

## How do I answer these questions?

Honestly. That's the key part - always speak the truth. Companies are not looking for "saving the world" examples; Instead, they're looking for _consistent positive behaviour_ when dealing with challenging situations. To convince them of that, you draw from examples in your past work history, looking for stories that match what you are being asked about, and then _tell them as a narrative_.

Let's look at an example:

_At Amazon on 2020, my team was tasked with delivering a new feature on the payment service; By Q4, we should accept a new payment method, with complete integration with reconciliation and fraud services. I was tasked with integration to the fraud services. My first challenge was in consuming their APIs without incurring into throttling limits and other non-functional concerns; We expected a high throughput due to ramped up adoption of the new payment method, and had to provision capacity to adequately handle customer traffic. I conducted weekly sync ups with Frauds team to, at first, clarify our requirements, and then track deliverables on their end to ensure our launch could happen on time and without issues. I had to escalate two issues to principal engineers in order to resolve minor technical conflicts, but otherwise the reviews happened on time and on schedule. The project was launched in October 2020, on time, and adoption of the new payment method was 7% above expectations. Despite this, our capacity planning ensured that we did not incur into throttling issues, leading to a 5% below average number of incidents, compared to other popular payment methods._ 

Let's look at reasons why this is a great answer.

## Have a method

I strongly favour `SBI` - *S*ituation, *B*ehaviour, *I*mpact - which can also be referred to as `STAR` (Situation, Task, Action, Results). It boils down to a simple idea:

* Have a "setup", just like in comedy when telling a joke, to explain the context;
* Clearly outline your tasks and responsibilities. Separate them from the broader "team";
* Describe the results (impact) of your work. Use data to avoid ambiguous statements that cannot be checked.

> At Amazon on 2020, my team was tasked with delivering a new feature on the payment service; By Q4, we should accept a new payment method, with complete integration with reconciliation and fraud services.

This is our situation. The reader understands the importance and scale of the project we were assigned to.

> I was tasked with integration to the fraud services. My first challenge was in consuming their APIs without incurring into throttling limits and other non-functional concerns; We expected a high throughput due to ramped up adoption of the new payment method, and had to provision capacity to adequately handle customer traffic.

This is also part of the setup. Here, we are outlining our _own_ responsibilities in the project. Everyone wants to be a team player, and that's a great thing. In an interview, however, we're interested about _you_. What was _your_ role at this project?

> I conducted weekly sync ups with Frauds team to, at first, clarify our requirements, and then track deliverables on their end to ensure our launch could happen on time and without issues. I had to escalate two issues to principal engineers in order to resolve minor technical conflicts, but otherwise the reviews happened on time and on schedule.

And here we have our actions, demonstrating our behaviour. The decisions you have made, the difference you have made in the project. You can outline what is considered "common sense", but you also want to make sure they hear about what you did that is "above and beyond" what you'd fairly expect for your role. Remember, you're selling your skills here, so be a good salesperson!

> The project was launched in October 2020, on time, and adoption of the new payment method was 7% above expectations. Despite this, our capacity planning ensured that we did not incur into throttling issues, leading to a 5% below average number of incidents, compared to other popular payment methods.

And here we talk about results, showing data. It's not enough to say "and we were happily ever after", you need to demonstrate how success was measured and why and how you've reached this conclusion.

### Tips

* Study your resum√©, reviewing your work experience for examples
* Consider other sources as well: community work, other things you do outside of work
* Practice behavioural interviewing on _both sides_ if you can
* Learn about metrics and how to outline data in a narrative

### Common Traps

**Inconsistent narrative**

Your answer should read like someone "describing the room" if you couldn't see it. You shouldn't jump between first and third person, and your tone should be neutral. Pretend you're interviewing for a TV show, or telling a story to your kids. If you ever played an table-top RPG before, this is like the role of the dungeon master: they describe the situation, they are descriptive, they don't assume you know.

**Be concise**

Do more with less. "We have achieved outstanding results with this motivated team, leading to a successful launch" is a drag to say and even worse to hear. "The project launched by X with Y impact" is what your interviewers want. Save the poetry.

I love this Mark Twain's quote:

"I didn't have time to write a short letter, so I wrote a long one instead."

**Vocabulary**

Avoid repetition, buzz words, and complicated technical statements. Your answer should be readable by anyone with basic background in your domain. You can introduce some explanation into your answer, when you can safely assume the reader is unfamiliar with the technical domain; But remember the rule about being concise.
